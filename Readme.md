# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app solution

This is a solution to the [Tip calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX). 

This tip calculator is able to perform calculations for any amount of tip you intend to donate and for any number of people based on a percentage from your bill.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties*
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

*HTML and JS almost fully implemented while CSS styling is next on my agenda. 

### Continued development

A simple project to test how much grasp I have on vanilla JS concepts while I continue my journey learning React. Speaking of React, I intend to produce a React version of this App in the nearest future!
Expect an edit soon!
