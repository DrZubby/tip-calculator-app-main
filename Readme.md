This is a forked repo with certain inputs and suggestions

##But due to scss compiler incompatibity, i cannot make a pul request to aviod messing the orinal codes up

### I used vs code scss compiler which created a dist file contaiing the css files

## WHAT I DID

I set the cursor property of all the buttons to the value of pointer

I added an :focus pseudo element to the select tip buttons and set with the pseudo element, i added an outline color with the value of 2px solid cyan;

I added a border colour to the custom but and i also used the :hover pseudo element to add a background property containing a hsl colour

I added a class with the value of bill-input to the form input element titled Bill. I used this class to add a border colour and an outline colour

Finally, i also did the same thing for the form input element titled Number Of People with the only diffrence being that it already had an id with the value of bill-input.
